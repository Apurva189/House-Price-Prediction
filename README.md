- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Scikit-learn** (for model training)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data handling)

## 📌 Notes
- The model (`banglore_home_price_prediction_model.pickle`) and location data (`columns.json`) must be present in the project directory.
- The predictions are based on the trained ML model and may not reflect actual market prices.

## 🛠 Future Improvements
- Enhance UI with better styling.
- Improve model accuracy with more data.
- Add charts for better visualization.
